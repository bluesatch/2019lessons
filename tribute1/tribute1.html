    <h1 id="top"><span class="title">My Top Five Trumpeters</span></h1>
    <p class="lead-in">These are a list of my top five trumpeters (in no order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#Nick">Nicholas Payton</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Miles">Miles Davis</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Morgan">Lee Morgan</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Hargrove">Roy Hargrove</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Byrd">Donald Byrd</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="Nick">Nicholas Payton</h2>
    <img src="media/meandnick.jpg" alt="Nicholas Payton and I at Prime Example">
    <p class="bio">Nicholas is not only a great trumpeter, but a master multi-instrumentalist and <span>vocalist</span>. I've seen him perform several times. He is also a friend of mine with whom I enjoy talking about music and eating po boys with.</p>
    <p>These are my top three Payton albums:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmPTxmq-zsw">Afro-Caribbean Mixtape</a></li>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>Letters</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
    <h2 id="Miles">Miles Davis</h2>
    <img src="media/miles.png" alt="Miles Davis">
    <p class="bio">In the conversation as the most important musician in American History, throughout his career, Davis changed the course of American music several times. Along with Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie, Miles crafted techniques and styles that have set the standard for players during his time and afterwards.</p>
    <p>These are <span>my top three</span> Davis albums:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqNTltOGh5c">Kind of Blue</a></li>
        <li>E.S.P.</li>
        <li>Big Fun</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
    <h2 class="bio bio2 bio3" id="Morgan">Lee <span>Morgan</span></h2>
    <img src="media/morgan.jpg" alt="Morgan">
    <p class="bio">Benefitting from working early with Art Blakey, Morgan not only had a fiery playing style, but his compositions were intense and displayed a youthful exuberance. His life story is just as interesting as his playing.</p>
    <p>My top 3 Morgan albums:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w2IwbbKq_g">The Sixth Sense</a></li>
        <li>Lee Way!</li>
        <li>Search For a New Land</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
    <h2 class="bio" id="Hargrove">Roy Hargrove</h2>
    <img src="media/hargrove.jpg" alt="Roy Hargrove">
    <p class="bio">Hargrove broke barriers and blended not only styles but generations of music together to create a unique and flavorful style.</p>
    <p>My top 3 Hargrove albums:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJyWi8AQSXQ">Hardgroove</a></li>
        <li>Nothing Serious</li>
        <li>Distractions</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
    <h2 id="Byrd">Donald Byrd</h2>
    <img src="media/byrd.jpg" alt="Donald Byrd">
    <p class="bio">Byrd incorporated his life experiences into his music and was a trailblazer in pushing the "J" word forward and leaving the traditional format into a younger, funkier sound in the 70s. Hip Hop producers have Byrd to thank for his compostions which have been sampled well over a hundred times.</p>
    <p>My top 3 Byrd albums are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX9Eup3Brtk">Stepping Into Tomorrow</a></li>
        <li>Black Byrd</li>
        <li>Slow Drag</li>
    </ol>
